In a previous version of this work,
the parameters $\theta = [\alpha, \beta]$ were calculated incorrectly
because the Kullback-Leibler divergence was defined in the wrong direction.
The impact on generation time parameters and statistics is as follows
(original $\rightarrow$ fixed):
shape ($\alpha$): $1.813 \rightarrow 1.633$,
scale ($\beta$): $2.199 \rightarrow 2.498$,
mean: $3.99 \rightarrow 4.08$,
\sd: $2.96 \rightarrow 3.19$.
The qualitative interpretation of results is unchanged,
and the corrected numerical results are given in this version.
We sincerely apologize for this error.\\
